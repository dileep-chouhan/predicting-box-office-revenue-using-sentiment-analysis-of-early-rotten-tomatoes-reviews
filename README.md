# Predicting Box Office Revenue using Sentiment Analysis of Early Rotten Tomatoes Reviews

**Overview:**

This project explores the relationship between early Rotten Tomatoes review sentiment and a movie's box office revenue within its first week of release.  The goal is to develop a predictive model that can leverage this readily available data to improve the accuracy of box office revenue forecasting, ultimately aiding in more effective marketing budget allocation. The analysis involves collecting Rotten Tomatoes review data, performing sentiment analysis, and building a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Requests (for data scraping - if applicable.  Remove if not used)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details about the model's performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., scatter plots showing the correlation between sentiment and revenue, model performance graphs) in the `output` directory.  These files will provide a visual representation of the analysis and model's predictive capabilities.  Specific output file names may vary.

**Data:**

(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.)  For example:  "The data used in this project consists of Rotten Tomatoes review data scraped from [Source URL] and box office revenue data from [Source URL].  Data cleaning and preprocessing steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting text data to numerical representations suitable for model training."

**Future Work:**

(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project.) For example: "Future work could involve exploring more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques, incorporating additional features (e.g., actor popularity, genre), and testing different machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy."


**Contributing:**
